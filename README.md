# JS Calculator

## Introduction

One of the best ways to learn JavaScript syntax is to revisit familiar problems and concepts with our new language. We will be re-writing our calculator project in JavaScript!

Feel free to reference your Ruby calculator project.

## At a Glance

- Individual, [stage 1](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/pedagogy/blob/master/classroom/rule-of-three.md#stage-1) project
- Due before class, **Wednesday December 9th at 9:00am**
- Submit this project with a PR

## Learning Goals

- Write JS code with statements that practice conditional logic, using `if`, `else if`, or `else`  when appropriate
- Write JS code with statements that practice loops when appropriate
- Write JS code that reads an object
- Practice creating, storing, and modifying variables
- Practice creating and using functions

## Objective

We will build a calculator command line interface (CLI) to perform simple arithmetic. The program should use an input variable that contains two numbers and an operation to provide the result of applying the operation to the two numbers.

Our JavaScript projects, **our projects will NOT take user input,** and instead **we will use a variable to hold and represent user input.**

## Setup Requirements

1. Fork this project repo
1. Clone this repo onto your computer
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
1. Work on this project, mostly within `calculator.js`

## Getting Started

You should write your program as a series of statements within the file `calculator.js`. Anyone with this file (including you) should be able to run the command `node calculator.js` to execute the program.

Look at the existing `calculator.js` file. There is a variable to represent example user input. Instead of using `gets.chomp` in this project (or the JavaScript equivalent to start), we will simply use variables like this one.

```javascript
const exampleAdditionInput = {
  num1: 3,
  num2: 5,
  operation: 'add',
}
```

We're starting the project with a variable (instead of a `gets.chomp` equivalent) because:

1. Practicing reading from objects is important, as they are *the most important data structure in JavaScript*
1. It's a little bit of work to get a JavaScript-`gets.chomp` going, and right now our focus is on learning syntax of conditional logic, calling and defining functions, and woring with data.

Feel free to alter or create the variables to your needs.

### Sample Tests

We have also included [tests in this project](./test/calculator.test.js).  You do not need to know how they work at present.  These tests simply insure that if your funciton is called with `promptInput` holding the value:

```javascript
{
  num1: 3,
  num2: 5,
  operation: 'add',
}
```

You will print: "3 + 5 = 8" with `console.log`.

Similarly if `promptInput` has the value:

```javaScript
{
  num1: 3,
  num2: 4,
  operation: '*',
}

```

Your funciton will print "3 * 4 = 12".

You can run these tests with the command:  `npm test`.

## Implementation Requirements

When a user runs this program, the program should **read a variable within the program to represent user input.** That "user input" lives in an object with a structure like this:

1. a number for the calculation
1. a second number for the calculation
1. a math operation

The program should use this input operation and two numbers to provide the result of applying the operation to the two numbers.

- The program should have support for these four operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The program should accept both the name and the symbol for each possible operation. The expected names and symbols for each operation are the following:
  - `add` and `+`
  - `subtract` and `-`
  - `multiply` and `*`
  - `divide` and `/`
- You may add other names or symbols to the above operations
- There is no requirement to consider handling uppercase versions to the command above: you are required only to handle the lowercase versions of the operations above
- The program should gracefully handle unexpected user input by doing the following things:
  - check if the input is invalid. What happens if the user input is `nil` (i.e., the user just pressed enter)? What happens if the user tries to `add` `hotdog` to `elephant`? What if the user input is `hotdog` for an operator?
  - if the input is invalid, output a message to the command line that informs the user that the input was invalid

## Hints

  Consider structuring your file like this:

  1. At the top of your file, define a `const` variable that represents user input. Feel free to use the example variable we gave you, and rename the variable or values as appropriate.
  2. In the middle of your file, define a function named `calculate`. This function should take in one parameter named `input`.
  3. At the end of your file, call the function named `calculate`, and pass in the example user input variable you created at the top of your file. This line of code probably looks like `calculate(exampleAdditionInput)`

  Other things to consider:

  - The `if... else if... else` syntax is very different and a lot more strict in JS than in Ruby
  - There *is* a `switch` statement in JavaScript
  - Testing equality on strings in JS usually uses `===`, not `==` like in Ruby
  - Reading values from key-value pairs in objects (the thing that looks like a Ruby hash) can use either dot-notation or bracket-notation
  - Make plenty of helper functions! This will help you organize your code

</details>

## Manual Testing

We haven't dived into unit tests in JavaScript yet, so _you must test your function manually._  You can run the function and use terminal-based user input with `npm start`, or you can run `calculator.js` manually with `node calculator.js`.  There is an example of manually testing the function in `calculator.js`, written as a comment.

Before project submission, test and verify that your program works as expected with the following testing/verification requirements.

To make sure your program works you will need to run your program and check against the following criteria:
*  The program adds numbers accurately with both `add` and `+`
*  The program subtracts numbers accurately with both `subtract` and `-`
*  The program adds numbers accurately with both `multiply` and `*`
*  The program adds numbers accurately with both `divide` and `/`
*  The program handles divide when attempting to divide by zero
   *  Simply print 'You cannot divide by zero'
*  The program handles erroneous input.  For example the user might enter `clown` when asked to enter a number
   *  For erroneous numbers simply print something, if the user entered 'clown' for `num1`, 'clown is not a number'
   *  The program also needs to handle erroneous operators
      *  Simply print in this case: 'unsupported operator'
      
## A note about the code format

You'll notice the calculateUserInput function takes two parameters, `error` and `input`. This is to conform to the format expected by the `prompt` package, which is being used when you run `npm start`. You will probably not use the `error` parameter at all and that's totally ok and expected.

If you're curious to see how we're plugging your function into the `prompt` package, checkout the [`index.js`](/index.js) file!

If you're curious to read about this `prompt` package, you can read about it on its [github page](https://github.com/flatiron/prompt)!

## Optional Enhancements

The following is a list of optionals. Should you be ambitious to continue working on this project beyond the requirements, here is a list of features that are interesting. These enhancements are not listed in any particular order; feel free to pick an enhancement from anywhere in the list!

### Other Enhancements

- Gracefully handle unexpected/erroneous user input with the following method:
  - output a message to the command line that informs the user that the input was invalid
  - asks the user to re-enter the input for the same prompt
  - does this until the input is valid
  - uses the newer, valid input
- Print out the formula in addition to the result, i.e. `2 + 2 = 4`
- Add support for computing exponents (`2^4 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16`)
- Add support for the modulo operator (`10 % 3 = 1`).
- Make your program know when it needs to return an _integer_ versus a _float_.
- Add support for parentheticals, i.e. `10 / (5 + 5) = 1`.
- Add support for handling all cases (uppercase, capitals) for the operations, so that `ADD` and `add` and `Add` (and other combinations) are handled in the same way

Please note that you will only be graded on the requirements, and not on the optional enhancements.
